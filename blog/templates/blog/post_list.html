			<p>My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun. Coral is far more red than her lips red. If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun; If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head. I have seen roses damask'd, red and white. But no such roses see I in her cheeks. And in some perfumes is there more delight than in the breath that from my mistress reaks. I'd love to hear her speak, yet well I know that music hath a far more pleasing sound. I grant I never saw a goddess go,- My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground. And yet by heaven, I think my love as rare, As any she belied with false compare.</p>

			<p>You do not have to be good. You do not have to walk on your knees for a hundred miles through the desert, repenting. You only have to let the soft anmal of your body love what it loves. Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine. Meanwhile the world goes on. Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain are moving across the landscapes, over the praries and the deep trees, the mountains and the rivers. Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air, are heading home again. Whoever you are, no matter how lonely, the world offers itself to your imagination, calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting - over and over announcing your place in the family of things.</p>
